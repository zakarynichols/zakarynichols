# Zakary Nichols
Software Developer | Problem Solver

I build systems and tools end-to-end: from idea and architecture, to development, testing, and deployment, to monitoring, optimization, and scaling in production. I focus on creating solutions that solve complex problems reliably, efficiently, and maintainably, ensuring real-world impact every step of the way.

## Experience

### MFB Technologies – Align Binders (Remote)
**Frontend Developer** | Apr 2021 – Oct 2025  
*TypeScript, React, Node.js (internal tooling/dev tools), Pipeline scripts (DevOps)*

- Built an interactive platform that allowed multiple users to annotate and navigate documents in real time, ensuring smooth collaboration on large files.
- Developed systems that automatically resolved conflicts when multiple users edited the same document simultaneously, keeping data consistent.
- Created a library of reusable, high-performance TypeScript components that sped up development across multiple projects.
- Improved real-time state management to handle rapid updates, ensuring the interface remained responsive and accurate during heavy usage.
- Built a comprehensive binder export feature that organized and exported entire binder structures with tabs and documents in the correct hierarchy, implementing complex logic to ensure data integrity and proper formatting.

### Auctioneer Software (Remote)
**Frontend Developer** | Feb 2021 – Apr 2021  
*Node.js backend, SQL (MySQL) with Knex, React, TypeScript*

- Delivered end-to-end feature implementations spanning database schema migrations, Node.js business logic, and frontend integration.
- Designed and extended SQL migrations to evolve core auction data models while preserving backward compatibility and data integrity.
- Developed and optimized Node.js service handlers for real-time auction events, ensuring consistent, low-latency communication between client and server.
- Integrated new backend endpoints into the React frontend, streamlining user interactions and improving system reliability across the stack.
- Collaborated with product and backend teams to debug system-level issues, analyze data flows, and maintain stability under high traffic conditions.

### Firefly Integrations – VegaTouch Team
**Frontend Developer** | Oct 2020 – Feb 2021 | Middlebury, IN  
*Capacitor.js, React, TypeScript*

- Developed and maintained a TypeScript + React application that interfaced directly with embedded RV control hardware via Capacitor.js and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
- Worked with the firmware engineering team to debug communication between mobile and microcontroller layers, resolving issues related to endianness, signal framing, and protocol timing.
- Designed and tested application logic for real-time control of physical RV systems, including lighting, HVAC, power distribution, and tank sensors.
- Implemented fault-tolerant data synchronization between the mobile frontend and the multiplexed control network, ensuring consistency across asynchronous hardware states.
- Contributed to system-level investigations spanning firmware, BLE communication, and frontend layers, improving overall reliability and responsiveness of the control system.
- Documented integration workflows and assisted in establishing debugging procedures for future firmware–frontend collaboration.
