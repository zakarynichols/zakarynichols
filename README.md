# Zakary Nichols
Software Developer | Problem Solver

I build systems and tools end-to-end: from idea and architecture, to development, testing, and deployment, to monitoring, optimization, and scaling in production. I focus on creating solutions that solve complex problems reliably, efficiently, and maintainably, ensuring real-world impact every step of the way.
